# NBA-Players-Analysis

In this Data Analytics project I'm trying to find the most overpaid and most underpaid NBA players based on their influence on winning.
For this project I'm using Python with Frameworks: Beautiful Soup, Pandas and later on I will use MatPlotLib.
This is a work in progress now as I'm missing data about players contracts.
